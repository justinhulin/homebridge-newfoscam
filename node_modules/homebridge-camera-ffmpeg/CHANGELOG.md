### Breaking Changes

homebridge-camera-ffmpeg now comes bundled with it's own pre-built static ffmpeg binaries that are compiled with support for audio (libfdk-aac) and hardware decoding (h264_omx). The following platforms are supported:

* Raspbian Linux - armv6l (armv7l)
* Debian/Ubuntu Linux	- x86_64, armv7l, aarch64
* Alpine Linux - x86_64, armv6l, aarch64
* macOS (10.14+) - x86_64
* Windows 10 - x86_64

If your platform is not supported the plugin will fallback to using your global install of `ffmpeg` automatically.

Should you wish to force the plugin to use the global install of `ffmpeg` instead of the provided copy, you can simply set `videoProcessor` option to `ffmpeg`. Example:

```json
{
  "platform": "Camera-ffmpeg",
  "videoProcessor": "ffmpeg",
  "cameras": [
    ...
  ]
}
```
